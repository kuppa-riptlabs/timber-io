Today is a glorious day! After almost a year of development, testing, and learning, Timber is
now open for public beta. So what does this mean? For you hands-on people, this means you can
[sign-up](https://app.timber.io) and try out Timber right now. For everyone else, here's
the low-down:


## First things first, what is Timber?

One the surface Timber is logging completely re-thought. It's every






One the surface, Timber is a new take on

It was a reaction to our previous experriences with logging solutions and all of the frustrations
solved in one tool.


Timber is a modern approach to logging.

Every detail was questioned, analyzed, and improved. From writing the logs to using them.


On the surface Timber is

## Demo

First things first, here's a quick demo of what we've build:


## So what is Timber?

Timber isn't simply a logging solution, Timber is your best friend when things go wrong.
Timber allows you to solve problems in record time. And Timber eliminates the anxiety of
not having the critical data you need to do your job as a developer effectively.
Nothing beats clean, rich, raw data. That is Timber.


## How is Timber different?

1. **It's just _better_ logging**. Nothing beats well structured raw data. And that's exactly
   what Timber aims to provide. There are no agents, special APIs, or proprietary data
   sets that you can't access.
2. **Improved log data quality.** Instead of relying on parsing alone, Timber ships libraries that
   structure and augment your logs from _within_ your application. Improving your log data at the
   source.
3. **Human readability.** Timber _augments_ your logs without sacrificing human readability. For
   example: `log message @metadata {...}`. And when you view your logs in the
   [Timber console](https://app.timber.io), you'll see the human friendly messages
   with the ability to view the associated metadata.
4. **Long retention**. Logging is notoriously expensive with low retention. Timber
   offers _6 months_ of retention by default with sane prices.
5. **Normalized schema.** Have multiple apps? All of Timber's libraries adhere to our
   [JSON schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema). This means queries, alerts,
   and graphs for your ruby app can also be applied to your elixir app (for example).



## How we got here

When we set out up build Timber we wanted a better logging system. One with sane prices,
parsing that works, and a clean, modern, fast interface. What happened
