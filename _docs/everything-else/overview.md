Timber was designed to be a great logging platform first. Raw text logs are fully supported and
Timber was intentionally designed to work with these. While our libraries add useful context,
there are many situations where they are not applicable.

This section outlines the many way you can send logs to Timber, with or without context. Please
note, these methods are under active development and we are radiply prioritizing them in our
development backlog.

If there is an integration missing, please let us know by chatting with us using the icon
in the bottom right.
