Timber was designed to be a great logging platform first. Raw text logs are fully supported and
Timber was intentionally designed to work with these. While our libraries add useful context,
there are many situations where they are not applicable.

This section outliens the many way you can send logs to Timber, with or without context. Please
note these methods are under active development and we radiply prioritizing them so that we
can suppoer the various platforms and protocols.
