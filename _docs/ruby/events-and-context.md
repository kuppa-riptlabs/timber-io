breadcrumbs: Timber for Ruby
title: Events & Context
---

By [installing the Timber for Ruby library](https://github.com/timberio/timber-ruby) your
application will automatically start collecting events and context.

To your left you'll see a sub-navigation listing all of the events and contexts the Timber
library capture.

If you aren't sure what events or context means, checkout our
[events & context doc]({% link _docs/app/basics/events-and-context.md %}).
