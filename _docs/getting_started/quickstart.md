This guide will walk you through getting started on Timber. Each step includes screen-shots, and
the process itself should take less than a minute.

## 1. Start by signing up

   **[{{ site.app_url }}]({{ site.app_url }})**  <--- sign-up here

   This is your _personal_ account. There is no need to create accounts for
   separate organizations. You can read more about how your account works [here]()

## 2. Create your first organization.

   Organizations are an umbrella entity. They contain applications, team members, and billing.

## 3. Create your first application.

   Each application represents a stream of logs. We ask for the details below because it allows
   us to provide simple and clear installation instructions. No need to sift through pages of docs!
