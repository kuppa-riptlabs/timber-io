If your app is on Heroku, Timber parses and recognizes a number of events in your Heroku log
stream automatically.

To your left you'll see a sub-navigation listing all of the events and contexts Timber extracts
from the Heroku log stream.

If you aren't sure what events or context means, checkout our
[events & context doc]({% link _docs/app/basics/events-and-context.md %}).
