title: View Metadata & Context

With Timber, each log line has
[additional metadata attached]{% link _docs/app/basics/events-and-context.md %}. Metadata is at the
core of what makes searching, alerting, and graphing so powerful in Timber. But sometimes
you need to just see the data. Achieving this is simple:

## Steps

1. Click the log line

That's it! :)


## Demo

![Viewing context]({% link assets/img/docs/viewing-context.gif %})


## Sharing this metadata

When you click the log line the URL in your browser changes. If you send that URL to someone
they'll see exactly what you see. Read our
[link to a log doc]{% link _docs/app/tutorials/link-to-a-log.md %} for more details.
