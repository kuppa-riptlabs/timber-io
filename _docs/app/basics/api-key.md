With Timber, each application is assigned it's own unique API key. This gives you greater
control of the data flowing into your Timber account.

Obtaining your API key is easy:


## 1. Obtaining an API key for a new application

If you have not created an application, please follow the
[quick start guide]({% link _docs/getting-started/quickstart.md %}) to create one. You'll
notice your API key is displayed after app creation.


## 2. Obtaining an API key for an existing application

If you've already created an app:

1. Navigate to your organizations application list.
2. Click "Settings".
3. Click "Installation" at the top of the page.

Here's an example:

![Obtaining API key]({% link assets/img/docs/obtaining-api-key.gif %})


<div class="next">
  Next: [{{ page.next.title }} <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>]({{ page.next.url }})
</div>
