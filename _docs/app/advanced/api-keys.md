An API key in Timber is what grants access to send logs to a specific application. You'll notice
each application is assigned it's own unique API key.

Generally you should not have to use this API key directly. Timber displays copy / paste
installation instructions that make setup easy.


## Obtaining your API key

If you've already created an app:

1. Navigate to your organizations application list.
2. Click `Settings`.
3. Click `Installation` at the top of the page.

Here's an example:

![Obtaining API key]({% link assets/img/docs/obtaining-api-key.gif %})


### Don't have an app yet?

If you have not created an application, please follow the
[quick start guide]({% link _docs/getting-started/quickstart.md %}) to create one. You'll
notice your API key is displayed immediately after app creation.
