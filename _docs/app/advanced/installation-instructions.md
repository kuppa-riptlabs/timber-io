Each app comes with a set of recommended installation instructions. The goal is to make it
easier to get setup on Timber and avoid the need to sift through pages of documentation.


## Locating your installation instructions

If you've already created an app:

1. Navigate to your organizations application list.
2. Click `Settings`.
3. Click `Installation` at the top of the page.

Here's an example:

![Installation instructions]({% link assets/img/docs/obtaining-api-key.gif %})


### Don't have an app yet?

If you have not created an application, please follow the
[quick start guide]({% link _docs/getting-started/quickstart.md %}) to create one. You'll
notice installation instructions are displayed immediately after app creation.
