Timber's API keys are tied to each application you create:


## Obtaining an API key for a new application

If you have not created an application, please follow the
[quick start guide]({% link _docs/getting_started/quickstart.md %}) to create one.


## Obtaining an API key for an existing application

If you've already created an app:

1. Navigate to your organizations application list.
2. Click "Settings".
3. Click "Installation" at the top of the page.

Here's an example:
