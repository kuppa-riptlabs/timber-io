When you right click in the console, it will bring up a context menu:

The options explained:

* `View context` - This opens the context panel for inspection.
* `Copy log message` - Copies the raw log message to your clipboard.
* `Copy link` - Copies the direct log line link so that you can share it with others.
* `Drop marker` - Adds a marker within the timeline for reference. This is a great way to
  "plant a flag", so that you can see new lines that have come in since.
