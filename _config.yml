faqs:
  - title: How does it work?
    desc: Once the Timber library is installed, it will automatically <a href="/docs/app/basics/events-and-context/">decorate your logs with useful context and events</a> (user info, requests, queries, etc).
  - title: How do I install Timber?
    desc: Simply <a href="https://app.timber.io">sign up</a> and choose your language and platform, from there you will be guided through a very brief installation process that will give you everything you need.
  - title: How much does it cost?
    desc: Timber offers a <a href="/pricing">variety of plans</a> (including a generous free tier) to suit any company size. Paid plans start at $8 per GB of data sent.
  - title: Which apps do you support?
    desc: Currently we have libraries for <a href="https://github.com/timberio/timber-ruby">ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir">elixir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/timberio/timber-node">node</a>, but can also accept logs from any app that runs on Heroku.
  - title: What data can I collect?
    desc: You can see all of the possible fields in our <a href="https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema">JSON schema</a>, but you can also add your own custom context and events.
  - title: How is this different?
    desc: Most logging platforms accept only raw text or JSON payloads. Timber <a href="/docs/app/basics/events-and-context/">allows you to attach metadata (events & context)</a> to your logs and provides <a href="/docs/getting-started/the-timber-libraries/">libraries</a> that handle this automatically for you.

pricing_faqs:
  - title: Can I cancel at any time?
    desc: Absolutely, simply log into your account, navigate to billing, and click "cancel".
  - title: How do you calculate usage?
    desc: Anytime you send data to the Timber service we record it in bytes. 1GB = 1,000,000 bytes.
  - title: What happens if I go over my limit?
    desc: We'll politely ask you upgrade. We will <em>never</em> drop your data unless your account is severly delinquent.
  - title: What about rate limiting or spikes in usage?
    desc: No problem! We don't rate limit. Send data as fast as you'd like.
  - title: What happens if change plans?
    desc: We'll pro-rate the new plan at the remaining time for the period.
  - title: Can I customize my plan?
    desc: Yep, just chat with us in the bottom and we'll create a custom plan for your needs.
