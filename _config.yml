- title: How does it work?
  desc: Once the Timber package or gem is installed, it will automatically decorate your logs with useful context and events (user info, requests, queries, etc).
- title: How do I install Timber?
  desc: Simply sign up and choose your language and platform, from there you will be guided through a very brief installation process that will give you everything you need.
- title: How much does it cost?
  desc: Timber offers a variety of plans (including a generous free tier) to suit any company size. Paid plans start at $8 per GB of data sent.
- title: Which apps do you support?
  desc: Currently we have packages for ruby, elixir and node, but can also accept logs from any app that runs on Heroku.
- title: What data can I collect?
  desc: You can see all of the possible fields at https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema, but you can also add your own custom context and events.
- title: How is this different?
  desc: Most logging platforms accept only raw text or json payloads. Timber automatically structures your logs so they're consistent, and augments them with custom context and events.
