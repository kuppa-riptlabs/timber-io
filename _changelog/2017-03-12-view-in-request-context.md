Have you ever searched for a line and wanted to view it in the context of it's HTTP
request? Today we added a tag that makes this as easy as a click. Here's a demo:

![View in request context]({% link assets/img/docs/view-in-request-context.gif %})

View logs in context is often critical to resolve issues quickly. And we're constantly
looking for ways to make this easier.

We also added a new [docs page for this feature]({% link _docs/app/tutorials/view-in-request-context.md %}).

Enjoy!
